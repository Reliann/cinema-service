# cinema-service
This is part of my fullstack course projects. It's a management system for users that saves info both on database and json files.
and also gets information from another server on https://subs-ws.herokuapp.com/ source (https://github.com/Reliann/subscriptions-service)
A one, hard coded user is able to add user that act as admins and they can add movies, and edit the members of the site.
you can take a look via login with {username: visitor, password:1234} to the site on: https://cinema-subs-ws.herokuapp.com/auth/
(movies and members will take abit to load since the other server needs to wake up)
